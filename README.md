# fiftenzies

A coursework project from Scrimba which has been modified. 
Essentially, it's a game where you need to try and keep rolling the dice until you end with all of the dice with the same number of values. Once you win the game, a confetti drops to show that you have won!

I attempted to rebuild the whole project by myself to further solidify my understanding of React components, props, state, and conditional rendering. 
I also, modified the styling a little bit and made the number of dice from 10 to 15 dices.

I also added a few extra features:

- To be able to keep track of how many rolls it takes to win the game.
- To see how long it will take to win the game
